most important ones from each container group. You will not need to use in the exam

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.100
any containers I do not discuss.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.200
First, sequence containers store their elements in some short of well defined order

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.800
We have vectors, lists, deques, etc. But the most important one is the

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:00.500
vector. This is similar to the vector we defined earlier. It's a variable size array 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:07.000
class and it encapsulates a raw heap array and its size. Like we discussed earlier,
